# a-neural-network-from-scratch
I built basic neural network just numpy &amp; math (without Tensorflow or Pytorch)

# Versions

## v1.0

### Features
- Reads data
- Shuffles and splits data into train and dev sets
- Initializes random parameters
- Performs forward and backward propagation
- Utilizes ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
- Performs gradient descent
- Builds a neural network with desired hidden layer dimensions
- Conducts training for the desired number of iterations
